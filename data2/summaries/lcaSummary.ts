      "LCA and carbon assessment trainings business unit wise on a regular basis will generate more awareness and better implementation. The engineering I work in sometimes dates from the 19th century and mostly through practical engineering reasons (occasionally cost), the infrastructure owners sometimes need to maintain this old equipment. However sometimes, using, producing and transporting new equipment may cause more problems with emissions to the environment than maintaining the older equipment. My role does not call for much of these kinds of conversations as I work to support Ramboll colleagues mainly however when it comes to ordering of consumables or arranging couriers for the movement of items I do always consider carbon footprint, etc. Regardless of this, it makes me feel proud to know that I work for a business with sustainability at its core. translated from Finnish: If we really want every project to be in the best possible way sustainable development compliant, in my own industry, every project should include emission calculation or at least the designers should have such strong experience in emission measurement that the best solutions can be chosen for each target from the perspective of sustainable development. Do we consider the environmental impact of other businesses that products we use and work with or do we solely focus on the results of our work achieving net-zero targets. Should we be focusing on the cost of energy from our offices, the mobile phones and technology we buy etc. Good to know abt LCA ad how it has a Major scope. I would like some more information about LCA impacts for different building materials, such as wood vs. concrete I think its a good idea to implement LCA in the discussion with the clients. This module is one of the best. However, I still need to see some deep insight of a project in Ramboll where this has been done sucessfully and created value to project and Client. Furthermore evidence that it has reduced the CO2e significantly. Adopt a life cycle Mindset and Implement it to be trained to use LCA more and more in my daily work I think adopting an LCA mindset should be embedded in all employees as a starting point, hence this training is valid and actual. we should always talk to client regarding the LCA in the starting of the project and give the clear picture with the help of expert, so the project developer knows how much Carbon emission is going to produce during this project and how he reduced it for cleaner and greener environment. provide guidance on using LCA Tools for refurbishing buildings and replacing or installing new MEP systems the tools of Lca should be in our design software for all the version LCA trainings about tools and data collection This is a crucial aspect for sustainable projects development. translated from English:\nCan we standardize LCA's within our most common areas of consultancy? Focus LCA on projects where it really makes a difference and not all projects. translated from English: Choice of building materials, structural systems are key factors, and they are often formed very early in the design phases, potentially as early as idea phases. I believe this just illustrates how important it is to take up this dialogue early in the project in order to guide a client in a more sustainable solution, one with a better carbon reduction.\nDenmark, Consultancy East  - Bygherrer√•dgivning Carbon assessment training to be provided to every employee so that he/she can evaluation self about any building or project. Carbon Reduction should be a part of our design process,Carbon Assessment provides us with an understanding of the magnitude of the carbon emissions associated with our building projects and where we need to focus our attention. We are focusing and developing mindset in design process in projects and carbon calculation in initial stage to reduce. And also following in our daily life routine for avoiding carbon emissions. I am learning LCA. Would be good to have a practical demonstration on the difference between LCA and carbon assessment. LCA calculating tools should also be shared with certain examples to showcase how to actual calculate the factors. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) I understand use carbon assessments to support carbon reduction strategies in my projects. i understand about LCA. See an interesting between LCI and LCA It is useful to know how regulated LCAs are. A great advantage to reduce carbon in the design phase. we always talk to the client. Regarding LCA and should have positive mind set to adopt it. Carbon assessment tranings to be provided with certification translated from English:\nNowhere have i seen Ramboll report how our digital storage affects the amount of carbon we generate from the large and expanding data storage centres. This is an industry that already reports more than 3% of worlds annual carbon generation ; higher than the airline industry of 2%; and digital storage is increasing year on year and Ramboll's strategy is pushing ever more digital technology which in turn increases digital storage thus increasing carbon emissions. But none of this is reported or accounted for in Ramboll facts and figures - this is incongruous with Ramboll statements on being a sustainable business It will be good to take care of Life Cycle Assessment in the Projects.",
    summary:
      "Looking into the feedback from the Ramboll employees, it becomes clear that there is a strong interest and need for regular trainings on Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and carbon assessment across different business units. Providing these trainings would generate greater awareness and facilitate better implementation. Employees are already considering the carbon footprint in their roles and it's suggested that adopting an LCA mindset should be embedded in all employees. The feedback also suggests a desire for practical demonstrations of LCA and carbon assessment, as well as the integration of LCA tools into design software. There's also a call for more information regarding LCA impacts for different building materials. Ultimately, the employees believe that focusing on LCA from the start of a project, particularly in choosing building materials, can significantly contribute to the project's sustainability and carbon reduction.",
