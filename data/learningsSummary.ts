      "I would like to learn how someone who is not involved in the sustainability team can make big strides in sustainability. I would also like to know how I can do this as a junior level staff. LCA and carbon assessment trainings business unit wise on a regular basis will generate more awareness and better implementation. Ramboll is taking great steps to incorporate sustainability while accounting for different projects, their employee and for providing solution to clients. More articles should be published in sustainability domain coming from the employee based on their projects experience. Would be interesting to see the 2024-version of the scheme \"% Emissions Related to Ramboll's Absolute Targets (from 2019)\" presented in this module. translated from English:\nHow the table can show that the building systems are responsible only for 0-1 % of embodied carbon? The reality in Nordics is completely different, from 20 to 50 %.\nIn the beginning different GHGs it might be good to tell that for example methane breaks in atmosphere to CO2.\nCCUS could be told to be both Carbon Capture and Utilisation or Storage, not only storage I'm curious to know in what stage should Ramboll ask about Client's approach and policies on maintaining human rights and when is the good time to walk away from a tender if we find out about a violation of the human rights in the client's end? translated from English:\nI feel the difficulty applying this approach to Ramboll Japan since the Japan is so behind about decarbonization and especially about the awareness of reduction of plastics. I do not feel any connection between our team's daily activities and the corporate sustainability goals. Does the top management involve the intermediate managers in the sustainability actions? Sustainability is the only way forward and I am happy being part of a company that does not just believe this, but shows it in its projects and day to day activities. A video summary of the annual results or a townhall with the annual results will help in understanding the annual report and the sustainability initiatives better translated from English:\ndecarbonizing for net zero and by creating resilient society. translated from danish: How do we organize ourselves internally in order to create holistic, sustainable solutions for our customers? And how do we communicate internally and externally about our work on sustainability in projects. I need to review the information for the Centre of Intelligence and GRT. translated from Finnish: Here we are only in the first few days at Ramboll, so the sustainability situation is not yet clear. translated from Finnish: The most important thing here is consulting the subscriber and selling ideas, otherwise sustainable planning cannot be done. Look forward to learning specific module for each unifying theme I'm happy to work towards sustainable change. I think it's a right path for the company but I'm wondering how this impact my role as financial project assistant? Each project that Ramboll undertakes can perhaps have completion brief highlighting how the any of the 4 sustainability themes were applied or perhaps a novel way that sustainability was promoted in the project to inspire others to use in future projects. we have a challenge in convincing many clients to commence the sustainability journey translated from Finnish: Let's target the trainings better for different professional groups. as a new Ramboll team member I'm very happy about so many colleagues with wonderful team-spirit, transparency and inspiration for a better world. I want to be one of these change-partners... The engineering I work in sometimes dates from the 19th century and mostly through practical engineering reasons (occasionally cost), the infrastructure owners sometimes need to maintain this old equipment. However sometimes, using, producing and transporting new equipment may cause more problems with emissions to the environment than maintaining the older equipment. Business enablement is not always shown in the sustainability examples on the training or well represented when showcasing progress within Ramboll. translated from Finnish: More ready-made tools to use in daily design. translated from Finnish: In addition to general education offerings, it would be good to have something tailored for technical fields. For example, group discussions possibly with an experienced mentor. It's important to talk regularly about sustainability and good examples that are relevant for us and our clients so that everyone are updated and feel comfortable with it. I would like to see \"Sustainability\" itself clearly defined. Needs to be a prt of sustainability workshops for a project better understanding of the SURE sustainability tool and more learning modules and how to apply to site solutions activates I like to improve more sustainability towards environment Love the development in sustainability within Ramboll. Smaller or niche departments may required different type of support The modules are great. However, we should have actual examples of the decarbonisation from projects. Moreover, we should have more examples what the actual pain points of the client in terms of sustainability and solutions how we can tackle them. It would be good to have a short talk/interview/podcast with project managers/project staff on how they have integrated sustainability in their projects. I think it is important to supporting the agenda of sustainability by also focusing on safety an well being of the people who are building the projects. It is very important for the society that those people dont get sick and can last many years. translated from English:\nWorking with certain clients, e.g. oil giants and Ramboll itself still being in the oil business is very questionable. Especially with all the green marketing.\nThe social pillar of sustainability is lacking behind. A global company should discuss its forms of colonization and efforts of decolonization.\nNo dividing trash in German headquarters in Hamburg makes me sad! Please make it obligatory.\nOh and if the organization is foundation-owned, why did I hear that Sacher GmbH bought it? Better communication of the Plan to CEMEA countries. I have just started at Ramb\u00f8ll, have never spoken to any customer about sustainability. why am I being asked about what i do and what i don't do when talking about sustainability with customers? I love how invested Ramboll is about sustainability. Considering how big Ramboll is, I think an important next step in sustainability within the office could be going paperless. The government made a big mistake with lack of engagement of the public with the enforcement of the Ulez zones, so that there has been massive opposition.\n\nThis is a massive project that will affect our lives and livestyles. To achieve successfully everyone needs to be involved and clear communicaitons must be made, so that we are working together. translated from English: Make some one /two volunteers as Net Zero ( Future Ready Champs ) team in each team collating all the list of projects and where this concept being implemented or not. If  not how to do that discussing with clients Sustainable business includes adhering to human rights. We act resolutely for climate and nature, pepole and lasting values. Sustainability is an integral part of the ZF strategy. Our goals include reaching full climate neutrality. I hope that in the big picture, Ramboll can have an impact on the general discussion on sustainability as currently companies seem to be focused on CO2 emission savings instead of actual circular economy and also the use of virgin raw materials. translated from Finnish:\nIn the design and planning of waterway bridges, it would be possible to design a spawning area for endangered fish species (e.g. trout) under the bridge. The construction costs of the spawning area remain relatively low in connection with bridge construction work. I would like concrete examples to integrate sustainability better into Environmental Due Diligence projects. Great learning. Ramb\u00f8ll need to invest in their employees and der skill regarind the project model and what to do specifically in the different phases. What to suggest to the clients, which is sustainable. Great intro. Ramb\u00f8ll need's to invest in the skills of their employees to ensure this ambitious goal. Might be useful to link / be updated with Paris Agreement / Global international laws mental sustainability is something to reinforce and enhance with ramboll. in terms of work-life balance and flexibility in working style These trainings are very good. I had no idea what Ramboll itself does for sustainability. At least, in year 2030, as it is the \"goal\" year for so many of our targets, we should have a huge info session to show how well Ramboll has achieved these targets, where we are at the point in our sustainability, what will be next etc. A yearly sustainability check would be nice too to show how things are improved during one year: How much emissions have decreased or how much of our projects are linked to sustainability etc. I was missing more about how the diversity in technologies offers solutions in different situations and the benefits it can have to use several carbon capture technologies. \nHow the landscape of possible solutions methods in the future can and will influence the strategies put forward by Ramb\u00f8ll. The slide asking \"What can you do to start working with the Unifying Sustainability Themes?\" should require everyone to select each business unit to see how that BU interacts with sustainability services. The information presented behind each business unit label should illustrate/articulate how the different business units can and need to work together to deliver these sustainability services. This tool should be promoted more within different offices. It can be utilized also in department meetings and small talks during coffee breaks. In addition, Water use -theme can be further developed by adding Water quality and issues related with that. Tools to help staff be more mindful of sustainability in their personal lives and small changes that can be made to create big changes translated from Finnish: If everyone lived like Finns, there would be only about one billion of us and we would consume about 0.7 Earths per year. Everybody focus on goals for 2030 and thanks for that :-)\n\nWhat happens after 2030?\n\nWhat happens if we as society dont reach our objective in 2030? translated from finnish: In this module, I had the idea that there is a need for concrete examples and tools. My perspective is that there is still work to be done to better incorporate sustainable development into projects at a practical level (not just settling for minimum solutions that we have already become accustomed to and that come to mind first and are acknowledged as having addressed sustainability), and especially in terms of assessing the sustainability impacts of a project, my resources are currently limited. translated from Finnish: Our rambollians should change our own culture regarding keke, but it's not equally easy for everyone. Could Ramboll support the progress of keke culture, for example by offering 'free' keke coaching 'semi-compulsory' to some project managers for one project? In small and urgent projects, there is hardly any time or money for keke matters. The transition to the culture is not equally easy in all units, because project types and project culture can be so different between different units. I think, we all of us group one tree in one year, and save water, and focus on green and clean.",
    summary:
      "Looking into the feedback from the Ramboll employees, there is a clear interest in incorporating sustainability more deeply into the company's projects and day-to-day activities. Employees express a desire for more training, particularly in areas such as Life Cycle Assessment and carbon assessment. They also suggest more frequent sustainability updates and the use of examples from projects to illustrate sustainability in action. There is a call for clearer communication about sustainability goals and how they connect to the work of different teams, including those not directly involved in sustainability projects. Additionally, employees note the need for the company to consider its broader impact on areas such as human rights and decarbonisation. Overall, there is a strong commitment to sustainability, with employees keen to play their part in driving sustainable change.",
