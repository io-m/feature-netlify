      "I would like to learn how someone who is not involved in the sustainability team can make big strides in sustainability. I would also like to know how I can do this as a junior level staff. Use AI to make decisions for fire simulation. AI can be a huge bank for ideas and previously simulations with results, which can gather all previous simulations. And help us do new simulations that has not been done before. There is a lot of opportunities in fire simulations, fire technical solutions and more. Would be interesting to see the 2024-version of the scheme \"% Emissions Related to Ramboll's Absolute Targets (from 2019)\" presented in this module. translated from English:\nHow the table can show that the building systems are responsible only for 0-1 % of embodied carbon? The reality in Nordics is completely different, from 20 to 50 %.\nIn the beginning different GHGs it might be good to tell that for example methane breaks in atmosphere to CO2.\nCCUS could be told to be both Carbon Capture and Utilisation or Storage, not only storage translated from English:\nI feel the difficulty applying this approach to Ramboll Japan since the Japan is so behind about decarbonization and especially about the awareness of reduction of plastics. Sustainability is the only way forward and I am happy being part of a company that does not just believe this, but shows it in its projects and day to day activities. Help with knowledge sharing of sustainable solutions for classical engineering disciplines like \"what is sustainable electronics\" and sustainable alternative (to)steel materials, where both strength, lifetime and technical requirements has to be comparable to existing industrial stanadrs. Is always important to understanding Sustainability Fundamentals. Is always important to Understanding Sustainability Fundamentals. translated from English:\ndecarbonizing for net zero and by creating resilient society. I need to review the information for the Centre of Intelligence and GRT. translated from Finnish: I'm trying to internalize sustainable development. translated from Finnish: Here we are only in the first few days at Ramboll, so the sustainability situation is not yet clear. The engineering I work in sometimes dates from the 19th century and mostly through practical engineering reasons (occasionally cost), the infrastructure owners sometimes need to maintain this old equipment. However sometimes, using, producing and transporting new equipment may cause more problems with emissions to the environment than maintaining the older equipment. translated from Finnish: In addition to general education offerings, it would be good to have something tailored for technical fields. For example, group discussions possibly with an experienced mentor. I would like to see \"Sustainability\" itself clearly defined. Add a info to explain or teach about tipping points. Biodiversity and ecosystems go hand to hand with tipping points. Needs to be a prt of sustainability workshops for a project More case studies that relate to projects and business development. sustainable practices in day-to-day work activities \n\nMinimizing time and energy spent on the road  is  an integral part. better understanding of the SURE sustainability tool and more learning modules and how to apply to site solutions activates I like to improve more sustainability towards environment Love the development in sustainability within Ramboll. It would be good to have a short talk/interview/podcast with project managers/project staff on how they have integrated sustainability in their projects. I think it is important to supporting the agenda of sustainability by also focusing on safety an well being of the people who are building the projects. It is very important for the society that those people dont get sick and can last many years. translated from English:\nWorking with certain clients, e.g. oil giants and Ramboll itself still being in the oil business is very questionable. Especially with all the green marketing.\nThe social pillar of sustainability is lacking behind. A global company should discuss its forms of colonization and efforts of decolonization.\nNo dividing trash in German headquarters in Hamburg makes me sad! Please make it obligatory.\nOh and if the organization is foundation-owned, why did I hear that Sacher GmbH bought it? I love how invested Ramboll is about sustainability. Considering how big Ramboll is, I think an important next step in sustainability within the office could be going paperless. We act resolutely for climate and nature, pepole and lasting values. Sustainability is an integral part of the ZF strategy. Our goals include reaching full climate neutrality. I hope that in the big picture, Ramboll can have an impact on the general discussion on sustainability as currently companies seem to be focused on CO2 emission savings instead of actual circular economy and also the use of virgin raw materials. translated from Finnish:\nIn the design and planning of waterway bridges, it would be possible to design a spawning area for endangered fish species (e.g. trout) under the bridge. The construction costs of the spawning area remain relatively low in connection with bridge construction work. I would like concrete examples to integrate sustainability better into Environmental Due Diligence projects. Checklist and process to propose clients on sustainable practices, cost saving calculators etc Might be useful to link / be updated with Paris Agreement / Global international laws How can we provide Taxonomy implementation suppport to clients when we have not implemented it ourselves ? I was missing more about how the diversity in technologies offers solutions in different situations and the benefits it can have to use several carbon capture technologies. \nHow the landscape of possible solutions methods in the future can and will influence the strategies put forward by Ramb\u00f8ll. Tools to help staff be more mindful of sustainability in their personal lives and small changes that can be made to create big changes translated from Finnish: If everyone lived like Finns, there would be only about one billion of us and we would consume about 0.7 Earths per year. translated from finnish: In this module, I had the idea that there is a need for concrete examples and tools. My perspective is that there is still work to be done to better incorporate sustainable development into projects at a practical level (not just settling for minimum solutions that we have already become accustomed to and that come to mind first and are acknowledged as having addressed sustainability), and especially in terms of assessing the sustainability impacts of a project, my resources are currently limited. translated from Finnish: Our rambollians should change our own culture regarding keke, but it's not equally easy for everyone. Could Ramboll support the progress of keke culture, for example by offering 'free' keke coaching 'semi-compulsory' to some project managers for one project? In small and urgent projects, there is hardly any time or money for keke matters. The transition to the culture is not equally easy in all units, because project types and project culture can be so different between different units. I think, we all of us group one tree in one year, and save water, and focus on green and clean. I am so proud of what Ramboll as a company and its management and employees are doing for sustainability. I wish these sustainability themes would be more emphasized more in smaller Ramboll offices (such as in APAC). The emphasis on these initiatives of Ramboll as a company may not be as massive in these countries than in EU. should we still include sustainability components in our project bid when a client is not sustainability-centric? if yes, it would drive up costs but wouldn't we be losing out to our competitors for the same project? I really like how Ramboll showcases itself to the public and what we are doing to get closer to our 2030 Agenda. But when transcending regional and cultural boundaries, I can see that there are still challenges ahead. As an advocate for sustainability in APAC, I currently still find it a bit hard to volunteer and deepen my expertise in sustainability. Though I surely do hope we can continue to align our sustainability aspirates in a global context in the coming years. I have had multiple projects where the client do not have any policy on sustainability or their project managers do not know it. As Ramb\u00f8ll has a highlighted sustainable agenda I assume that we cannot do a projects for the client without including some sustainability thoughts. Here I often need some guidance on how little we as a sustainable company can accept in the deliverables. As a newly graduated i cant interlink this module of sustainability training with what i currently do at work. this will be relevant once i am starting to run projects myself and have a direct contact with the clients. Can we visualise our steps forward to sustainability in Ramboll? For instance, if we accumulate the power production by renewables we contributed to, can we visualise how many fossil fuel power plants can be replaced? If we post positive and negative things around our offices on Yammer, can we remind our awareness of sustainability? I think sustainability and hours/ assigned time for evaluating environmental impacts should be part of all contracts that Ramboll do. I have found inspiration on how I can start to consider sustainability in my work I have found inspiration on how I can start to consider sustainability in my work translated from Finnish: The biggest obstacle to proper sustainable development expertise is the rush and performance requirements in current jobs. translated from Finnish: How do the Ramboll centers in India promote carbon neutrality goals and sustainable development, considering India is one of the most polluting countries. A link in module 3 leads to an error 404 page Ramboll's strategy is very good. I hope it is understood that making it reality is a long way and the next strategy is even more ambitious. Even though many projects cover these themes, they are still most often not ambitious enough. E.g. a green certification project often is a typical building, but it is seen as green thing to be working with. Or decreasing embodied carbon: there should be a decrease of maybe 90 % in order to be able to build new buildings that are in line with targets. We need a transformation capability that is based on a solid knowledge/experience of Change management, we need to create a urge for change (whiteout frightening people to much, which only paralysis people and makes them irresponsible) and we need to create attractive and working solutions that adds values to peoples lives (not only take things away) It is important to measure and report sustainability KPIs to influence and demonstrate the impact to a wider audience. This would be more at a project level than at a corporate level. The comment is already in English, so I will give back the comment as it is:\n\nAre Ramboll offices in India also with these sustainability themes and values? As I understand there are many big and serious environmental problems in India. How are Indian offices going to solve those problems in their country? translated from English: I think Ramboll should have focus on the heritage buildings, and how to preserve an in the sane time mange to use them in a better way, than to day could be an interesting way to get Ramboll \"on the poster\" due to sustainability. There are not so much competitors there. Window blinds can be kept open during daytime allowing natural light to come in and reduce the use of overhead lighting thereby conserving energy. The window blinds can be kept partially open if there is strong sunlight. Thanks for ideas to think understand sustainability translated from Finnish: Employees could be given a number of hours that they can use for promoting sustainable development or studying it, for example, per month. Currently there is no time for this, as everything is driven by economy and project profitability and sustainable development is not taken into account in offers. Big words, I'm not sure how it actually is happening in the work, especially the climate work. Climate targets should be more ambitious. In my opinion, we should also think big so that sustainable development also has a great value and we should not always just try to minimize costs and increase profit. When the option of sustainable development is real and not just a word, I think it touches the customers' conscience in such a way that they are also ready to pay for it, because it is also in their own interest in the longer term. I would love to see the changes suggested during Ollie Wildman talk about setting a carbon limiting value get implemented. I can always learn more about sustainability and the important of it translated from Danish: RAMB\u00d8LL is turning to cloud based computing and more recently to using AI (based on cloud computing). Do we include the energy consumption from this in our energy consumption? translated from Finnish: If we really want every project to be in the best possible way sustainable development compliant, in my own industry, every project should include emission calculation or at least the designers should have such strong experience in emission measurement that the best solutions can be chosen for each target from the perspective of sustainable development. Do we consider the environmental impact of other businesses that products we use and work with or do we solely focus on the results of our work achieving net-zero targets. Should we be focusing on the cost of energy from our offices, the mobile phones and technology we buy etc. translated from Finnish: As mentioned earlier, it would be good to expand the keke perspective to themes not directly related to infrastructure. As an employee, it is difficult to grasp the topic if, for example, you do not work directly with infrastructure-related issues, but rather aim to influence people. Create, store and keep a record/data on successful sustainable actions, solutions and suggestions. Such record could then be both developed and further utilized in other projects. A business approach to creating long term value by taking into consideration how a given organization operates in the ecological, social, and economic environments. A business approach to creating long-term value by taking into consideration how a given organization operates the ecological, social and economic environments. If possible it would be heartening to see a breakdown of how Ramboll avoids social harm in its work. For example in the energy sector in particular, there is concern from many about the conditions and practices involved in the harvesting and production of raw materials for various technologies (unethical mining etc) as well as factory conditions for key device components.\n\nThese factors are potentially very difficult to avoid in the modern market (short of producing all aspects and components of solutions in-house), but a periodic re-evaluation of the options available to reduce the impact/reliance on solutions with such issues would be valuable, and would allow the company to implement positive changes as early as possible should the opportunity arise. I think and important comment was raised, the market will start demanding sustainable solution. The transition agenda is no longer a visionary idea in academic circle, it is a demand from the communities. Ramboll has done an impressive strategic turnaround, but we need to ensure we keep the momentum. To meet the needs of the existing generation without compromising with the quality of the environment for future generations. The structures team can lead by using sustainability parameters as the guiding factor during optioneering Share good experiences, solutions and eventual suppliers solving re-use questions and problems. A highlight on sustainability success/challenges would help in developing these important topics further. What has worked? What has not? What are some actionable initiatives that augment and improve our work and do not add significant time investment? If we do commit non-billable hours towards improving our commitment to sustainability, will the (global) company support us? We need to come up with live project examples with reasoning which will enhance and enable the engineers to understand the sustainability pioneers' decision and approach to a problem. It would be good to have a sample of projects to illustrate the possibilities. as a fire planer there is limited opportunities to implement sustainability to our work. Ramboll and Henning Larsen could support some pro- Bono projects that work with social sustainability in poor countries and give our employees the opportunity to work in those project as volunteers with paid travel- food-  and stay-cost,  working together with colleagues from different countries in a project team for 3-5 weeks a year , on site. That could make a big difference, and be a really inspirational experience. What about sustainable population growth? Its mentioned very rarely in society but its a science-based fact: we live on a planet with limited - not infinite - resources. The world's population cannot go on growing like it does otherwise all the sustainability goals will never be met such as poverty, education, environment. None of them. What can Ramboll do about sustainable population growth? Are they brave enough to attempt anything? Sustainability is key to a bright and successful future translated from Finnish: Importing examples of projects under sustainable development into everyone's awareness would bring concreteness to the implementation. In my opinion, responsibility belongs to everyone, but change should be promoted especially from the management direction. With respect to EU Taxonomy it would help if it is confirmed that it applies to all business units outside the EU. As Ramboll UK Ltd is a separate legal entity does the EU Taxonomy apply? I will need to gain more knowledge about how sustainability is included in a specific design within my knowledge area Reduce usage of paper. Green to commute. Reduce paper usage translated from Finnish: The staff needs a training specifically tailored to the planning field on all key themes of sustainable development and implementation into projects. I would like some more information about LCA impacts for different building materials, such as wood vs. concrete As Employer I often have ideas how we, ourselves with in Ramboll, can reduce use of energy, how we can recycle better etc. But I need an easier way to address this! Today I address this true our Healt & Safety Incident Reporting system, but we need a separate portal for this. I think it would be remarkable that Ramboll projects strive to achieve sustainable certifications such as BREAAM from the initial phases of the design process. \"Don't do what I do, do as I say\". - I think Ramboll could first be sustainable within itself before \"lecturing\" others. For example: 1) Personal plants are forbidden in office (which makes no sense). 2) Many departments still have flight trips to foreign countries when it is more team building than business or some other more meaningful purpose (not sustainable) 3) There is no clear metrics how for example my department or any other department would be increasing it's \"sustainability effect\". (Attending a training is not doing anything, metrics checking for example reduction of CO2 emission would be something that has an actual effect on sustainability). This module is one of the best. However, I still need to see some deep insight of a project in Ramboll where this has been done sucessfully and created value to project and Client. Furthermore evidence that it has reduced the CO2e significantly. Within section one, there was a statement regarding non-renewable materials. It gave examples of Lithium and Uranium. I wouldn't necessarily consider Uranium to be a non-renewable. It is a grey area. There's enough supply to outlast our species at current rates of consumption and fast breeder reactors can create new fuel out of old. Yes, it is technically finite, however the volume available is practically limitless, it's just not currently economical to extract. translated from English: With ref. to \"How We Act\" Policies and procedures for the project model in Norway; SDG Scoreboard is a recommended tool for tender, planning and execution phase.\n\nThe tool is developed by Ramboll Water, but is applicable to all market units and help the project team to provide a sustainability assessment towards the 17 UN Sustainability Development Goals and sub-targets. Please refer to internal and external news articles.\n\nYou find the online sustainability tool at sdg.ramboll.com Thank you, now I understand what is EU Taxonomy and its importance for Ramboll services and opportunities. I would like to see detachment from the old and often falsely used concept of sustainable development, and more attempt to reach the 'strong sustainability' in which human capital cannot substitute natural capital.",
    summary:
      "Looking into the feedback from the Ramboll employees, it becomes evident that they appreciate the company's commitment to sustainability but are currently facing challenges in integrating and implementing sustainability practices in their respective roles and areas of operation. Many employees seek more concrete resources, actionable initiatives, and project examples to help them contribute to the company's sustainability goals. They also express the need for more training and knowledge sharing sessions on various aspects of sustainability, notably in identifying sustainable materials and technologies, understanding the dynamics of sustainable development, and navigating international laws and guidelines like the EU Taxonomy. Furthermore, employees suggest that Ramboll could focus more on internal sustainability, for instance by reducing paper and energy use, and ensure that sustainability considerations are incorporated into all projects, regardless of the client's initial focus. This feedback highlights the need for Ramboll to continue fostering a strong sustainability culture and providing its employees with the necessary tools and support to carry out their work in the most sustainable way possible.",

      "LCA and carbon assessment trainings business unit wise on a regular basis will generate more awareness and better implementation. I would like to propose the implementation of an Annual Virtual Employee Meeting for our team at Ramboll. Given the dynamic nature of our work environment and the increasing importance of remote collaboration, I believe this initiative will prove invaluable in keeping our workforce informed, engaged, and connected.\n\nThe Annual Virtual Employee Meeting will serve as a platform for disseminating important updates, sharing key achievements, and fostering a sense of unity and shared purpose among our employees. This meeting will provide an opportunity for our team members to participate from the comfort of their homes via Microsoft Teams, ensuring maximum accessibility and convenience for all. I do not feel any connection between our team's daily activities and the corporate sustainability goals. Does the top management involve the intermediate managers in the sustainability actions? A video summary of the annual results or a townhall with the annual results will help in understanding the annual report and the sustainability initiatives better translated from danish: How do we organize ourselves internally in order to create holistic, sustainable solutions for our customers? And how do we communicate internally and externally about our work on sustainability in projects. I'm happy to work towards sustainable change. I think it's a right path for the company but I'm wondering how this impact my role as financial project assistant? Business enablement is not always shown in the sustainability examples on the training or well represented when showcasing progress within Ramboll. It's important to talk regularly about sustainability and good examples that are relevant for us and our clients so that everyone are updated and feel comfortable with it. Better communication of the Plan to CEMEA countries. translated from Finnish: \n\nRemove coffee and R&D meetings from coffee/lunch breaks. The benefit disappears when you don't have the energy to attend these meetings. I prioritize shared breaks with colleagues over trainings/infos. These trainings are very good. I had no idea what Ramboll itself does for sustainability. At least, in year 2030, as it is the \"goal\" year for so many of our targets, we should have a huge info session to show how well Ramboll has achieved these targets, where we are at the point in our sustainability, what will be next etc. A yearly sustainability check would be nice too to show how things are improved during one year: How much emissions have decreased or how much of our projects are linked to sustainability etc. The slide asking \"What can you do to start working with the Unifying Sustainability Themes?\" should require everyone to select each business unit to see how that BU interacts with sustainability services. The information presented behind each business unit label should illustrate/articulate how the different business units can and need to work together to deliver these sustainability services. This tool should be promoted more within different offices. It can be utilized also in department meetings and small talks during coffee breaks. In addition, Water use -theme can be further developed by adding Water quality and issues related with that. Most of these measures are controlled and kept by the project managers. My role does not call for much of these kinds of conversations as I work to support Ramboll colleagues mainly however when it comes to ordering of consumables or arranging couriers for the movement of items I do always consider carbon footprint, etc. Regardless of this, it makes me feel proud to know that I work for a business with sustainability at its core. translated from Finnish: \nA certain tool or system was mentioned in several project phases. Could it be integrated into the PI-Tool or some existing system? Or for example, integrating the Sustainability Dialogue Tool into the PI Tool. If a new place and system are created, only those who remember would use it, but existing tools could be more usable. Great introduction to this important agenda for mankind The modules were very informative with lot of practical information on the application and 'EU taxonomy' translated from Finnish: It would be good if Ramboll had its own \"task force\" consisting of a multidisciplinary team. The group could solve challenges that have emerged in customer projects using \"radical creativity\". Innovative and interdisciplinary experts could collaborate to solve complex problems focusing on creative (out of the box) solutions. Showing respect and kindness to colleagues is essential in maintaining the feeling of safe workplace. Personal battles with the only purpose of showing to your co-worker how stupid he/she is (compared to you) are not a good sign at an inclusive workplace. We are all different and unique and have our own personalities. Yes, we meet challenges at work, yet we should not forget we aim to work together without imposing our own frustrations into other colleagues. Let's be good to each other no matter what. I work principally with facilities and location support in the UK. Would be great to have some department specific targets/ working groups/ ideas that can be taken forward across those functions If this topic is to be in our daily design activities, more real cases are to be read or digested. An internal design protocol will be good. My role is so far removed from any of the discussions points raised in this and other modules on sustainability, but things like the checklists, registers and databases could be built into the processes to allow monitoring of targets and goals on documentation, but as far as I can tell this is never discussed with the team I am part of, which I feel is a missed opportunity. There are lot of public networks in municipalities and regions working with sustainability, but the local Ramb\u00f8ll office is not a member in these regional initiatives, probably due to time and money. We should be much more visible in these networks. translated from Finnish: Uniform practices in projects would facilitate working with projects in different departments. Please include the material from the slides relating to carbon savings onto Templify so we have this at our fingertips.",
    summary:
      "Looking into the feedback from the Ramboll employees, there is a clear call for improved internal communication regarding sustainability initiatives. Employees are asking for increased awareness and understanding of how these initiatives connect to their specific roles and business units. Many suggested the implementation of regular, company-wide meetings and updates, including an Annual Virtual Employee Meeting, to disseminate information about sustainability goals and achievements.\n\nA desire for more tangible, relatable examples of sustainability in action within the company was expressed, with a specific interest in how this pertains to various business units. Some employees felt disconnected from the corporate sustainability goals, highlighting a need for more involvement and communication from top management.\n\nSeveral employees suggested the integration of sustainability into existing tools and systems to make it more accessible and actionable. They also suggested better representation of business enablement in sustainability examples to ensure a holistic understanding of progress within Ramboll.\n\nOverall, the employees are seeking better communication, more practical examples, and closer integration of sustainability into daily operations.",

      "If we shall success with AI in Ramboll it's Important that employees are educated in AI. Most of the Feedback activities are targeted for employees that have already made projects or have somewhat of experience in the fields. As a new employee these activities does not apply. Great learning. Ramb\u00f8ll need to invest in their employees and der skill regarind the project model and what to do specifically in the different phases. What to suggest to the clients, which is sustainable. Great intro. Ramb\u00f8ll need's to invest in the skills of their employees to ensure this ambitious goal. We need to walk the walk more. We have very little credibility when we are posting about our people flying across the Atlantic to collect awards on Linked In and Newsletters. It would have been a better look if we called in by video call stating that we have high standards when it comes to sustainability. Also people flying all over Europe to attend internal meetings. We are racking up tens of thousands of airmiles needlessly.\nWe are not joining up the dots when it comes to the clients we are working for. We should not be working for companies whose products rely on a high environmental and ethical impact. There seems to be no screening of clients to assess the sustainability and ethics of their operations.\nThis all points to failings in senior management and more training is needed for them to grasp what sustainability really means.

Employees feel that current training initiatives are not applicable for newer members of staff, highlighting the need for comprehensive guidance across all levels of expertise. There is a call for Ramboll to invest more in their employees' skills, particularly with respect to project model phases and sustainable client suggestions. Employees also draw attention to the company's credibility in sustainability, questioning the frequent flying for awards or meetings when alternatives such as video calls are viable. Furthermore, employees express concern about the company's lack of client screening in terms of environmental and ethical impacts. They propose that senior management needs additional training to fully understand and implement sustainable practices. Ultimately, the feedback suggests that Ramboll has ambitious sustainability goals, but needs to 'walk the walk' in order to reach them.",

      "translated from Finnish: More ready-made tools to use in daily design. The modules are great. However, we should have actual examples of the decarbonisation from projects. Moreover, we should have more examples what the actual pain points of the client in terms of sustainability and solutions how we can tackle them. translated from Finnish: Practical examples are needed for projects. Each industry is so different and there are so many different projects that these general trainings are not enough. Everybody focus on goals for 2030 and thanks for that :-)\n\nWhat happens after 2030?\n\nWhat happens if we as society dont reach our objective in 2030? It would be good to have reference to case study success stories. How have individual engineers or teams been influential in making a difference on their projects? Ideally these would be examples from commercial, industrial and residential projects not directly delivering environmental or renewable outputs. Maybe examples where we have delivered more for less, extended building life, re-used existing structure, used dismantled material etc. It would be more useful to have some practical examples where EU Taxonomy has been applied on various projects and have some good outcomes in the end. I am very positively surprised that the doughnut-type model of corporate sustainability is the goal in Ramboll. However, it still doesn't affect enough our day-to-day work. Most Ramboll employees (my experience) still consider sustainability more as a nice bonus or a trend to make money on, not as an inevitable system shift to ensure the survival of modern civilization.",

      "Looking into the feedback from the Ramboll employees, it is apparent that there is a significant concern about the lack of practical examples provided in the sustainability eLearning module. Many are calling for more ready-made tools for daily design and actual examples of decarbonisation from projects. The necessity of understanding client pain points regarding sustainability and ways to tackle them is also emphasised. There is a demand for scenario-based learning, particularly what happens post-2030 or if society\u2019s objectives for 2030 are not met. Furthermore, success stories from various sectors, including commercial, industrial and residential projects, where sustainability measures have led to beneficial outcomes are sought after. There is also a call for specific examples of the application of the EU Taxonomy on various projects. Lastly, the employees feel the current learning does not sufficiently affect their day-to-day work and suggest the need for a system shift in understanding sustainability as a crucial survival tool rather than just a trend.",

      "Monthly newsletters regarding AI implementation in Ramboll Ramboll is taking great steps to incorporate sustainability while accounting for different projects, their employee and for providing solution to clients. More articles should be published in sustainability domain coming from the employee based on their projects experience. I'm curious to know in what stage should Ramboll ask about Client's approach and policies on maintaining human rights and when is the good time to walk away from a tender if we find out about a violation of the human rights in the client's end? translated from Finnish: The most important thing here is consulting the subscriber and selling ideas, otherwise sustainable planning cannot be done. Each project that Ramboll undertakes can perhaps have completion brief highlighting how the any of the 4 sustainability themes were applied or perhaps a novel way that sustainability was promoted in the project to inspire others to use in future projects. we have a challenge in convincing many clients to commence the sustainability journey translated from Finnish: Let's target the trainings better for different professional groups. Smaller or niche departments may required different type of support I have just started at Ramb\u00f8ll, have never spoken to any customer about sustainability. why am I being asked about what i do and what i don't do when talking about sustainability with customers? The government made a big mistake with lack of engagement of the public with the enforcement of the Ulez zones, so that there has been massive opposition.\n\nThis is a massive project that will affect our lives and livestyles. To achieve successfully everyone needs to be involved and clear communicaitons must be made, so that we are working together. translated from English: Make some one /two volunteers as Net Zero ( Future Ready Champs ) team in each team collating all the list of projects and where this concept being implemented or not. If  not how to do that discussing with clients translated from English:\nRamboll should reserve some time for those people who really are interest in sustainability or have more understanding to prepare them to be reminding this to the client, even is not paid directly by the client, but will need to be open a new budget line for this. translated from Finnish: \n\nMonet E&H:ssa ty\u00f6skentelev\u00e4t projekteissa, jotka itsess\u00e4\u00e4n vastaavat tavoitteisiin esim. hiilineutraalisuudesta (tuulivoima, vihre\u00e4 vety). Kaipaan apuja, miten n\u00e4iss\u00e4 tapauksissa k\u00e4yt\u00e4nn\u00f6ss\u00e4 asioista voi keskustella ja miten olla se kumppani. Omalla kokemuksella ty\u00f6 painottuu siihen, kuinka yhdess\u00e4 asiakkaan kanssa p\u00e4\u00e4tet\u00e4\u00e4n niist\u00e4 toimista, joilla vastataan yh\u00e4 tiukempiin viranomaisvaatimuksiin, kun projektit kest\u00e4v\u00e4t useamman vuoden ja ohjeistukset ja s\u00e4\u00e4ntely saattavat sill\u00e4 v\u00e4lin muuttua.\n\nMany E&H employees work on projects that themselves correspond to goals such as carbon neutrality (wind power, green hydrogen). I need help on how to practically discuss these issues and how to be the partner. Based on my own experience, the work focuses on deciding together with the customer on the actions to meet increasingly strict regulatory requirements, as projects last for several years and guidelines and regulations may change in the meantime. I am interested in finding out more about how sustainability will be implemented in our day to day activities locally. We have had many discussions of the overarching strategy of sustainability that is often general in nature, but I think that we need to have more discussion on a local level. It would be great if a sustainability lead could be implemented locally to initiate conversations about sustainability and help us move toward our sustainability goals on a local level. There could be some kind of open forum for taking employee suggestions and discussing. It would also be very beneficial if the local sustainability leads could then discuss what they have been considering and implementing to share this knowledge across the whole company. I feel that there is room for improvement in our operations as a company and we need to discuss how to make that happen. We could also have optional discussions for employees for ways to improve sustainability in our personal lives outside of work for those interested. And the other piece is talking to clients about implementing more sustainable solutions, and I think that this is also something that we could discuss in the proposed sustainability \"groups\". Do Ramboll's commitments stop with the client? What if the client decides to use a contractor that may violate human rights? For example, if we design a structure and then the client decides to fabricate it in a yard in Dubai, where there may be a risk that human rights are kept to a minimum. What should we do in that situation? Are there learning modules available for those of us having a total focus on human health consulting? I did not answer several of the feedback activities as they did not feel applicable to my role. I very infrequently speak with clients, so it is not that I do/do not mention things during conversations, but rather I am not the one having these conversations Good to know abt LCA ad how it has a Major scope. It is a terrific tool in early phases in projects. For instance when we are enlisted for pre- studies we can help our clients to set goals and ambitions for their projects. That will increase our opportunities for more involvement and revenues in the project further on. I am not sure if this already exists, but if projects that are sustainability/resilience forward could be shared and read about that would be really interesting. As someone new to the company, any opportunity to learn more about what is actually going on with sustainability projects would be a huge asset for my eventual own client work. Interesting and gives a good idea on how Ramboll takes sustainability into consideration in different levels and possibilities. Ramboll just could make five simple principles to our clients and workers of sustainability. I think its a good idea to implement LCA in the discussion with the clients. translated from English:\nI feel that clients are not ready to be the best versions of themselves in sustainability issues. They rather be \"good enough\" than \"excellent\" which is not the right way. We as consultant house should boost their decision to be excellent and help them in every way. Nevertheless, everything still depend on money. Nothing happens without money. Hopely, this will change when the planet earth is on fire.",
    summary:
      'Looking into the feedback from the Ramboll employees, it is evident that there is a significant concern regarding limited client engagement in sustainability initiatives. Employees indicate difficulties in convincing clients to embark on the sustainability journey, with some clients opting for "good enough" rather than striving for excellence in sustainability. There is a clear call for more focused training and support for employees to enhance client discussions on sustainability. There are also queries regarding how to advise clients on maintaining human rights and concerns about potential violations. Suggestions have been made to incorporate sustainable planning and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) in client discussions. Overall, the feedback calls for a shift towards more proactive and well-structured client engagement in sustainability initiatives.',
