      "If possible it would be heartening to see a breakdown of how Ramboll avoids social harm in its work. For example in the energy sector in particular, there is concern from many about the conditions and practices involved in the harvesting and production of raw materials for various technologies (unethical mining etc) as well as factory conditions for key device components.\n\nThese factors are potentially very difficult to avoid in the modern market (short of producing all aspects and components of solutions in-house), but a periodic re-evaluation of the options available to reduce the impact/reliance on solutions with such issues would be valuable, and would allow the company to implement positive changes as early as possible should the opportunity arise.",
