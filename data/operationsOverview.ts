Could Ramboll support the progress of keke culture, for example by offering 'free' keke coaching 'semi-compulsory' to some project managers for one project? In small and urgent projects, there is hardly any time or money for keke matters. The transition to the culture is not equally easy in all units, because project types and project culture can be so different between different units.",
