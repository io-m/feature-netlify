For example, waste sorting is constantly done incorrectly at the office, and attention should be paid to this. Ramboll's car could be a gas car or some other low-emission vehicle instead of diesel. Company bicycles and commuting by bike should play a bigger role and be supported. The offerings could be meatless. Minimizing coffee waste, which seems to work quite well when there are coffee machines available. Regulating the office temperature so that it is not unnecessarily heated or cooled. In the summer of 2022, it was actually cold in the office, and one had to dress warmly inside, even though it was hot outside.\nIn all planning where something new is created to be built, the use of renewable materials and circular economy should be taken into account. Consume as little as possible, cut out all unnecessary things, but prioritize sustainable green construction, and specifically cherish what already exists, not replacing it with something new!",

      "I've seen the two versions of the sustainability diagrams presented- but they were referred to as strong sustainability (the one where the circles are nested) and weak sustainability (the venn diagram). Something the module does not point out is that in the one diagram where the circles are all enclosed by the environment is that society and out economy is limited by the boundaries of the environment which is an important distinction between the 2 diagrams.",

I think there is a yammer channel on the topic at least, but I and probably many others are still missing the existing key channels for the topic, so they could be mentioned. :)",
